# THE CHEESE DIARY

This is a cheese rating diary by debbie and elliott. Here we try different types of cheese, we rate
them base on taste and what pairings would go well. Structure might change later, but this is an
evolving document on the different cheeses.

Criteria:
```
1. Texture
2. Funkiness
3. Taste notes
4. Rind
5. The wow factor
6. Final score out of 10. [5 being average and 10 being get it everytime]
```

## TABLE OF CONTENT


### LANDANA 1000 Day GOUDA
1. Texture: Hard crumbly cheese.
2. Funkiness: 6/10
3. Nutty, not the complex of cheese flavour, but definitely aged. Slightly below average salt (not a
   pasta cheese). Quite similar to cheddar, has a sharpness.
4. Inedible.
5. -
6. 6/10, would get again but probably want to try others. Just slightly better than average.

Pairings:

- fruit paste
- nuts

Avoid soft bread with this, the sharpness needs something to cut it with. D likes soft cheese with
bread so this is a no no.
